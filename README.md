# CFODD
This is a model diagnostic metric that evaluates warm rain formation microphysical processes against satellite observations.
The methodology combines satellite cloud observables (e.g. radar reflectivity, cloud optical depth and cloud-top effective particle radius) 
to construct a particular statistics that "fingerprint" signatures of the warm rain formation process in the form of a 
contoured frequency diagram of radar reflectivity by in-cloud optical depth. 
The statistics are typically classified according to different ranges of the cloud-top particle size to depict 
how vertical microphysical structures tend to transition from non-precipitating clouds to precipitating clouds 
as a fairly monotonic function of the cloud-top particle size. 
The corresponding statistics are constructed from output of a given model for comparisons with the satellite-based statistics 
to expose how the model realistically represents the warm rain formation process in a statistical sense. 
The methodology is applicable to either of global climate models and cloud-resolving models.
